This is my repository for the Pixel Play challenge

All these files are independent and can be run if the dataset folder is in the same directory as the script for running the model

Additionaly, for vol based models there were extra frames apart from the ones in testing data so use the cleaner script to get a new submission file with the exact frames and
proper submission formatting.
